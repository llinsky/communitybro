Community Bro Network Security Monitor
============================

Bro is a powerful framework for network analysis and security
monitoring. Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions
and pointers for getting started. NEWS contains release notes for the
current version, and CB_CHANGES and CHANGES has the complete history of changes.
Please see COPYING for licensing information.

The CommunityBro mission statement is simple: We seek to expand on and accept changes
from a broader community to accelerate the development, deployment and ease the usage of
Bro. 

Organizations that long ago forked Bro for their own internal needs, but no longer
wish to maintain the differences should consider submitting to Community Bro - our default
license for submissions is ASF 2.0.

To get started:

    git clone git@github.com:CommunityBro/communitybro.git --recursive

For more documentation, research publications, and community contact
information, please see Bro's home page:

The CommunityBro Team would like to thank the Bro Core Development Team for their efforts.
